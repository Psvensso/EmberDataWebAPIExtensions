EmberDataWebAPIExtensions
=========================

WebAPI Extensions for working with Ember Data 1.0 beta > 

Roadmap: 
1. Generate Ember modells out of POCOS with annotations and serve up in dynamic route.


2. A TypeFormatter that parses JSON in the format that Ember Data is expecting (ActiveModel::Serialization type)
